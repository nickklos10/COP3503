# COP3503 Java Class Repository

Welcome to the COP3503 Java Class Repository! This repository is a comprehensive collection of Java files and resources used throughout the COP3503 course. Here, you'll find examples, homework assignments, project files, and additional resources that will assist you in mastering the concepts taught in the COP3503 class.

### About COP3503

COP3503 is an intermediate-level programming course that delves into specific algorithmic techniques in more detail than introductory courses. This course applies these techniques to new problems, emphasizing the practical application of algorithms. Additionally, the course includes more rigorous technical analysis to verify the efficiency of the discussed algorithms. Alongside these algorithmic studies, the course introduces a few new data structures, expanding the toolkit available for solving complex programming challenges.

### Getting Started

To dive into the COP3503 Java Class Repository, clone it to your local machine using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/nickklos10/COP3503

### Running java files

To run the Java files contained in the assignments, you will need to have Java installed on your machine. If you haven't installed Java yet, you can download and install the JDK (Java Development Kit) from Oracle's website or use an open-source alternative like OpenJDK.

Once Java is installed, you can compile and run the Java files using the command line:

1) Open your command line interface (CLI).
2) Navigate to the directory containing the Java file you wish to run. For example, if your file is in the assignments/week1/ directory, use the command cd path/to/assignments/week1.
3) Compile the Java file using the javac command:
   javac YourFileName.java

   Replace YourFileName.java with the name of your Java file. This command will compile your Java code and generate a .class file in the same directory.
   
4) Run the compiled Java file using the java command:
   java YourFileName
